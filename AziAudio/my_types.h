/*
 * minimum data types for MIPS and the Ultra64 RCP
 *
 * No copyright is intended on this file. :)
 *
 * To work with features of the RCP hardware, we need at the very least:
 *     1.  a 64-bit type or a type which can encompass 64-bit operations
 *     2.  signed and unsigned 32-or-more-bit types (s32, u32)
 *     3.  signed and unsigned 16-or-more-bit types (s16, u16)
 *     4.  signed and unsigned 8-or-more-bit types (s8, u8)
 *
 * This tends to coincide with the regulations of <stdint.h> and even most of
 * what is guaranteed by simple preprocessor logic and the C89 standard, so
 * the deduction of RCP hardware types will have the following priority:
 *     1.  compiler implementation of the <stdint.h> extension
 *     2.  64-bit ABI detection by the preprocessor
 *     3.  preprocessor derivation of literal integer interpretation
 *     4.  the presumption of C89 conformance for 8-, 16-, and 32-bit types
 *         and the presumption of `long long` support for 64-bit types
 *
 * In situations where the compiler's implementation chooses to control these
 * arbitrary sizes on its own or to exchange portability with C99 compliance,
 * the standard types (either built-in or external <stdint.h>) will be preferred.
 */

/*
 * Rather than call it "n64_types.h" or "my_stdint.h", the idea is that this
 * header should be maintainable to any independent implementation's needs,
 * especially in the event that one decides that type requirements should be
 * mandated by the user and not permanently merged into the C specifications.
 *
 * Compilers always have had, always should have, and always will have the
 * right to choose whether it is the programmer's job to establish the
 * arbitrary sizes they prefer to have or whether the C language should
 * be complicated enough to specify additional built-in criteria such as
 * this, such that it should be able to depend on a system header for it.
